Title: Helper Functions to Fit and Test Identification in Simulations
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ernesto Carrella
Maintainer: Ernesto Carrella <carrknight@gmail.com>
Description: A companion to the paper "No free lunch when estimating simulation parameters".
    What I think the field of Agent Based Models needs is just a straightforward way to estimate models
    that stresses (i) confidence intervals (ii) tests for identification. 
    The field is dominated by search-based methods which are opaque and hard to test so 
    here i just collect a bunch of reference table methods and approximate bayesian computation
    methods and provide them a common facade so that they are easy to call.
